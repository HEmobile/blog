Me and my fellows once have a meeting to decide what the site of Felloway should be: if it would be more serious or more lighthearted, focused on products or on the company, this kinda doubt. In the end we decided that it would be a connection between us and our partners, associates, friends and fans (if someday we have them).

One of the first things we decided was to put a blog on the site and we three agreed to write on it regularly. Not that it would become an obligation, but more of a habit. Write something, write anything. No rules, no strings attached. One word or two thousand.

So now I’m here with this virtual blank page in front of me and a tall blinking thingy waiting for me to start typing. But I can’t. I don’t know how to start.

However, now that I am thirty-one I finally know how to circumvent this.

Flashback fifteen years ago, I’m in high school. Posing as the creative type, I know how to draw, how to write, but ask me if I do it regularly. No, not at all. I dream the day I’ll write a movie script, or a novel, illustrate that novel, turn it into a graphic novel, crossover everything and become rich. I’m the man of ideas, I summon crazy concepts from thin air and ask my friends to help me turn it into reality. In the end I’m never satisfied with the result but I’m lucky to have patient talented friends who do it there own way, anyway.

Jump to college times. Yeah, yeah, I’m graduating in Advertising and plan to be a Creative Director in a few years. I get bored easily with the day-to-day life at small agencies, so I quit. I decide to be a freelancer graphic designer but I want to create big companies visual identities, not waste my time layouting small grocery store flyers. Of course that’s exactly what I end up doing.

Some jobs, positions, companies and years later I finally realized: having ideas is less important than executing them; as well as destinies are less enriching than the journey itself. When we dream with big ideas frequently we don’t consider if we have the knowledge, money, time, resources, life experience, professional expertise, influence, contacts and so many other factors to turn it into reality as magical as we dreamed. So, early in our lives, we try to do somethings, they don’t come out as expected, and in no time we have already forgot this episodes, but we seem to never forget the fear of imperfection, of critics, of failure. This fears lurks in our subconscious and, in opposition, our ideas will be much more attractive than our execution of them. More secure. Without notice we will start avoiding actually doing things.

When we realize this unconscious fear, we finally have the conscious choice to persevere. In the beginning we won’t write, draw, design, administrate or anything as good as we would like. But we will discover the difficulties of that action, the barriers, the traps. Then we will meet people who will help us, things will magically get easier just by repetition, and we will constantly improve. Suddenly our initial idea, our dream, will become less important than the journey of getting there. We will start to celebrate every step forward, every accomplishment. And the sum of all this countless little victories will be so great, that we will forget of waiting for a big celebration only at the end.

Now that I am thirty-one I finally know how to circumvent this fear. I know that the first step of a journey is the hardest. And that to write a post you just have to start writing. If you persevere, the post writes itself.
