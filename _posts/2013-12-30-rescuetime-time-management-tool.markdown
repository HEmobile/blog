In my first post on HE:Labs team blog I want to present a great time management tool: [RescueTime](https://www.rescuetime.com).

[RescueTime](https://www.rescuetime.com) automatically keeps track of which window is “in focus” when you are on your computer, and logs what activity you are doing and for how long you are doing it.

This data is private and only you have access to it. I've been using RescueTime after the tip of an employer but neither he or other employers saw my activity log.

With your activity information the application segments between productive or distracting time, calculates a productivity score and present rich reports about it:

It is also possible to adjust settings of what is more productive or distracting to your occupation. After that extreme data analysis it may be easier to choose to stay offline on Facebook tomorrow.
