After we finished to organize our office and some bureaucratic needs, Felloway completed in March its first month of productive working, I mean developing our first iPad app <a title="MixPrintPaint" href="http://mixprintpaint.felloway.com" target="_blank">MixPrintPaint</a>. We have been working hard to ship it, so we will finally feel that we are for real.

During this time, one thing kept buzzing up in my head. I stopped counting the days until friday.

If I think about it, I can’t really complaint about my previous job. I worked from 9 to 5, Monday to Friday in a nice environment. I had a great boss, lots of freedom about my holidays and my work, I was fairly paid and lived near my company. But more than often, I caught myself taking it one day at a time, and counting days until Friday or the next holiday. I think that besides all the good it was still a job by its definition, I was exchanging my time for money. (Therefore I wanted it to pass fast, to get my reward). I felt like I was living my life using the same tactics alcoholics use to stop drinking.

Now it is all different. I don’t exchange time for money anymore. I am using my time to live a new experience, learning new stuff per minute, trying to create something that I believe. I work more hours, honestly, I feel that I am working all the time, even when I shouldn’t, but it is hard to stop when you really want to have something done. It is stressful sometimes, and very rewarding as well. I don’t get any money yet. But for me, the biggest change is that now I enjoy my weekdays, I stopped desiring that they would just go away and disappear. Sometimes I even wait anxiously for the next Monday.

We are in May now, MixPrintPaint is waiting for review on the app store, and my feelings are still the same. It has been three months enjoying to work and doing my best for a great goal. I have to say that it is really rewarding the feeling that you are not selling your life anymore.

And I hope I can live like this for a long time. It is not easy, but as I read it somewhere “If something doesn’t scare you, it probably isn’t worth doing it”.

<strong>What do you say? Are you enjoying your work time or selling it? Would you change?</strong>
