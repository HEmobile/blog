<strong>We are alive! Finally!</strong>

We had that feeling, that urge to start something of our own for a long, long time. But life, with all its ‘problems’, gave us all the ‘fake’ excuses we needed to postpone it.

Until September last year, when we decided to stop waiting for the right time and start doing it.

We discussed it for a couple months and on January it all started. Two of us quit our jobs, the other one would help with some money, his free time and knowledge. We created our cooperative home office, and after a few meetings our first project was decided.

We have been working on it, for the past three months and it was amazing. We lost some nights, learned a lot and had tons of fun. Now our first product <a title="MixPrintPaint" href="http://mixprintpaint.felloway.com" target="_blank">MixPrintPaint</a>, has shipped to Apple for evaluation and it is coming soon!

We really hope it does good! But at this moment, the most important thing for us was to have it done.

Starting a business... It is scary. It is hard to now you will have no income at the end of the month unless your product succeed and there is no one else to blame about this. It all on us.

But even with all the problems, it has been easier and more rewarding than we expected. Maybe the real hard times are still to come, and we will fight through it, but we may need some help from our friends, family and supporters to overcome the bigger obstacles.

We count on you to share this dream with us!
