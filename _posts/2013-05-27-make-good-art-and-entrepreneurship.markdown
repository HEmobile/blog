I am huge fan of Neil Gaiman, and it is rarely the time when I hear or read something from him that I don’t like. I even wrote one of my few short movie screenplays inspired by one of his short stories. Now I am in a new adventure, and one that I wouldn’t really expect any help from him, but then... I came across his “Make Good Art” <a title="Neil Gaiman Commencement Speech" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plWexCID-kA" target="_blank">commencement speech</a>. It really inspired me, and I have a blog now, so I had to write about it.

It is impressive how an art focused speech can match so perfectly with entrepreneurship. When we started Felloway, we wanted three things: Be among friends, “Do things that we were excited about” and “Have a remarkable ride”. Two of our three wishes are near perfect quotes from his speech. And I believe it is nearly the same for everyone in the entrepreneurship world.

For me, the core of Gaiman speech is about finding what you want to do, and keep doing it until you do it well enough to make a living from it. Like he said, that is much harder than it sound, it is already hard enough to find what you want to make, and it is even harder to keep doing it through all adversities. Agreeing with him again I also believe that in the end it is easier than what we expect. When you are in this journey, you don’t feel like you are working, it feels like a scary adventure with an amazing reward at the end. Life itself. Happiness.

We still need to feed ourselves and pay our bills, but planning it well, making sacrifices, and even making some small detours to this distant mountain, will help us to keep walking to it, just always keep your goal in the horizon and I believe you won’t get lost.

We chose our path, and now we are making iOS apps to get to the mountain. Two weeks ago we launched our first iPad app <a title="MixPrintPaint Hot Site" href="http://mixprintpaint.felloway.com" target="_blank">MixPrintPaint</a>, a creative tool for kids to make their own coloring books. We have been marketing it since then, and my exactly feeling about it is “like putting messages in bottles, on a desert island, and hoping that someone will find one of our bottles and open it”. We still don’t know what people think about our product, because the bottles are still lost out there, but we will keep working until someone find them.

Entrepreneurship, like art, is about making mistakes and keep doing it until you do it right. We didn’t know the best time to launch our product, so we decided to launch it and focus on marketing afterwards. Just now we discovered that some review sites give priority to pre-releases, and that it takes some time to get your promo video approved by Apple. Big mistakes. Many more will come and we will keep learning things after we should have, but we are working, we are going toward the mountain and we are learning the rules while we go...because otherwise we would have to stop to learn them. We think it is better to make mistakes, big ones. It means we are out there doing something.

I will say again that it is hard, and that we don’t know when it will work, or even if it will work. But like Gaiman said “where would be the fun in making something you knew was going to work?”.

Now, go. Find your thing, do your best, improve your best, make mistakes and get up from them, learn from them and make some more. Until you get to the mountain.

Make Good Products. Make a Good Work. Make Good Art! It is all we can do.

Has Gaiman's speech inspired you too? I would love to hear about it.
