I think that everyone who tried to sell an iPhone or iPad app realized that to be found on the AppStore is a nightmare. It is really hard to find anything different than the top players or the featured items around there.

Doing our research about marketing an iOS App, we discovered some critical points. A great icon, thoroughly chosen keywords, a descriptive caption after the app name, a  hotsite and a promo video with no more than 60 seconds.

We worked hard to have them done before our release and as a small business with little to no money to spend on marketing, we struggled with the promo video. We had no camera or equipments, and honestly we also didn’t have a lot of time.

But I had a friend. A young guy that loves to make videos and might be interested in helping us. I talked to him and he promptly agreed to use his free time and make a promo video for us with no cost.

It was hard for both of us. We had no money to hire actors, so they kept changing their minds about the shooting and then he would need to find new ones. He didn’t have an iPad to run our app and he lived 300 miles away from us, so he had to borrow one from a friend and install a beta copy of <a href="http://mixprintpaint.felloway.com" target="_blank">MixPrintPaint</a> on it. We were delayed about two weeks and  when he finally could find some actors and meet them for the shooting, he knew that it would be his only chance to get the video done. One afternoon, with amateur actors, doing a favor for him, and one of them was a kid. Yeah, a little harsh. But he had it done, of course it wasn’t as perfect as both of us wanted, but it is great. And he might get a chance to fix the small bits later on. We got three nights of long skype meetings to edit it, and coincidently finish our promo video just the night before the release of MixPrintPaint on the AppStore.

Great! We were really happy and proud of ourselves.

Until, we used our new free time to read the AppStore Marketing Guidelines.

Then we just realized that we couldn’t release our promo video because we need to wait for Apple approval. It is our fault of course, that we hadn’t read the guidelines before, but if you are an indie, you know that it is hard to find time for everything and you need to prioritize your product. The fact is that Apple bureaucracy doesn’t help small business at all, and we have to deal with it.

Anyway. The Promo Video is done and in theory we finished all critical marketing points.

In reality it is far from over. Like I said, it is really hard to be seen on the AppStore. After discussing with my friends we decided that without spending money we have three chances to be seen, and all of them kind of include get lucky: get featured by Apple, be reviewed by a big blog/site or be tweeted by a famous person or a big shot. Not easy, is it?

We will do what we can. Keep posting on our website, Facebook and Twitter accounts. Keep talking about our app in forums and other communities that we belong, send emails to ask for reviews and so on.

All we want now, is real feedback about our app. It is not about making a lot of money. We just want to know if MixPrintPaint is as nice as we think it is, if there is some people who want to spend money on it. And of course hear from our costumers how we can make it better.

Any marketing suggestions for an Indie?

PS: Thanks, Pedrito! Without you we wouldn’t have our video!

PS2: The best lesson I got about creating a business until now: it is crucial to ask for help to your friends. At the very least you will discover which ones you can count on.
