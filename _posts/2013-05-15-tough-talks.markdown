Although we have launched <a href="http://mixprintpaint.felloway.com" target="_blank">MixPrintPaint</a> only a few days ago and Felloway were born in January, we worked in its creation since September 2012. We discussed ideas, lined up expectations and interests, studied important subjects for our projects and more. If we think about it, it has been 8 months of constant engagement between the three of us. And under some circumstances that is a significative time.

There are a lot of pressure and decisions to be made in the day-by-day of a startup. Varying from the strategic business elements to the simplest detail of a product. And that is without the pressure we put on ourselves. It is a lot of stuff to think, study, learn, decide and perform at the same time. Naturally, in so unstable environment some conflicts are going to arise.

The fundamental point to keep everything working smoothly is the constant feedback. The team needs to be closely aligned to keep the boat in the desired direction. However, the winds blow to many sides, storms will eventually appear and the boat needs to stay in route. Communication between all should be as frank, objective and transparent as possible. And that means having some tough talks.

These are tough talks, because it means touching on some complicated issues like money, commitment, focus or attitudes. It means saying what needs to be said, and make sure things are clear to everyone. It means being open and listen to what is said, and understand that the goal is to make things right. Unfortunately, many times we just postpone these conversations, feeling that something doesn't need to be said, or simply because we have other priorities at the moment. The problem is that the little things, when left untreated, accumulate, creating bigger and harder problems to deal later.

An experienced entrepreneur once told me that he and his partners had group therapy, such the need to fix some problems and the difficulty to achieve that without professional help. I hope we do not reach this point here, at Felloway, and we always keep constant and honest feedback. We are trying! Every day! We may stumble here and there, but being very honest, I think we're having much success! :)

The name of our company carries the term "Friendship" on it. We wanted to make it clear to everyone (including to ourselves), that before partners, we are friends, and what joined us at the beginning of this journey, holds us together every day!

I am very proud to work with these guys! :)
