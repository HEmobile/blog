Yesterday was lifted the embargo for the press to review one of the most anticipated games of the year: The Last of Us for PlayStation 3. All over the world major game sites are giving it high scores and praise. Watching the video reviews, one thought long gone in my mind—since last year trailers—returned: the staggering resemblance of the protagonist character Ellie and the actress Ellen (Page). I had to do a quick research to see if Ellen Page was in the game. Spoiler: she is not. I don't know if it was an intentional copy, a homage or pure coincidence. That's not the point. What it brings to my mind is: are appearance and mannerism Intellectual Property?

For those who don't know Ellen's work, she is an actress in fast ascension. After a great indie start in Juno, she was a supporting actress on a big Christopher Nolan's movie and already achieved protagonist status on a Woody Allen's. In the game world she will star as protagonist this year in a big game—almost an interactive movie—of Quantic Dream playing the character of Jodie. The game is called Beyond: Two Souls.

With this impressive curriculum, Ellen would perfectly fit as Ellie in The Last Of Us, and in my opinion would do a great job. I'm a fan of her work, and I don't know if she was even invited for the role, but what really bothers me is: is she (or any other famous actor) still really necessary for this kind of project in 2013 and onwards?

To help us think last consider more information. The game industry left the movie industry behind years ago. The Avengers has the currently record of box-office opening weekend sales of a movie, earning US$ 207 millions. The game Call of Duty: Black Ops II has the record for the best selling launch day for a game, earning US$ 500 millions in the first 24 hours. Even though the game industry being richer, in an exaggerated example it could invest far less in a game: one actor could do the motion capture of many characters, a couple of voice actors all the voices, and a lonely writer the lines of them all.

I know that movie stars are more than the personification performers make of characters. Their appearance, charisma, mannerism, and even personal life are all components of their success. But this year we will receive a new generation of video-game consoles with better—and more realistic—graphics and sounds. The animation and CG industries are also striding. What if we could borrow the appearance, charisma and mannerism of Kiefer Sutherland but make him slightly different, maybe younger too, to avoid litigation, and then make a game or animated movie of an FBI hero agent that fights terrorism acts in real-time on American soil? Done by the talented guys behind Splinter Cell games it would be great, wouldn't it?

Now you could be assuming that I am judging, but I'm not. In my opinion this is neither wrong, nor right. What I am stating is that our notion of what is an Intellectual Property, what we own after we create is eroding fast. The technological evolution proved to be ruthless and unstoppable. Since Napster, big industries are trying to battle it, and are failing miserably.

It is time for us creators—writers, illustrators, photographers, musicians, actors, chefs de cuisine, all—to take the reins in our hands and lead our future, changing our payments and rewards, the way the market works and, above all, the way we think.

Because today a character resemble an actress that didn't play it, yesterday the Chicago Sun-Times fired all their full-time photographers and gave iPhones to the reporters, tomorrow my microwave lasagna will taste like the best lasagna in the whole Italy. And creation will perish.
