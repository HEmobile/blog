I always thought about myself as a fast learner, but at the same time I was only learning what life brought to me. Starting from college, that I didn’t quite choose what I wanted but what I thought would fit me better and give me a good job. After that I was learning as my job demanded… Delphi, Java, PHP, more Java and so on.

I was learning because it was required and not because <strong>I wanted to learn something</strong>.

The change started about 2-3 years ago, when I was living in Dublin with few friends and a lot o free time. I realized that besides having a good job and some life experiences, I wasn’t happy with myself. Something was missing and I started to look actively for it. My first decision was to find a better use of my free time and learn something by myself. The time passed, some failures and successes with it, but now I am pretty confident to learn new things when I need or want.And that is great!

<h2>The Obstacles and Shortcuts I learned</h2>
After my experiences with self learning a few points looked to me as the difference between accomplishing my goals or not, here are my feelings about them:
<h3>1. Motivation</h3>
You need to find a way to stay motivated through the learning time, because no boss or teacher will be pushing you and sometimes only your desire to learn will not be enough. Things that worked for me: <strong>create short goals</strong> that once completed would make me eager to learn more, find at least <strong>one friend that wants to learn</strong> the same thing and share the experience (through email, Skype, etc), find <strong>a bigger goal</strong> that will benefit for your new knowledge (open a company, find a new job, enter a contest).
<h3>2. Finding Time</h3>
It is a lot easier to learn something new when you have enough free time, but it is possible to do it even if you are very busy. I have done both. My secret was simple. Organization. And I am far from the most organized person I know. <strong>Set a date to finish</strong> your learning (no more than a few months) and split your lessons (chapters of a book, classes of an e-course) in a <strong>few hours per week</strong>. I learned iOS Programming with as few as 3-4 hours per week divided in two days. It is hard to stay on schedule, but when you are late try to steal some minutes from other activities until you are back.

It also helps when you<strong> </strong>explain to your family or anybody living with you what you’re doing and why you aren’t expending the same time with them. Most of the time they will at least try to understand and help you.
<h3>3. Learning-by-doing</h3>
Practice is very important. It is really easier to read a book or watch classes, but at least for me the real learning happens at the time I put it to practice. Almost all good books or internet courses give you exercises from time to time, and it is crucial that you do some. It is time consuming and it will increase your learning time, but you will learn it properly.
<h3>4. Have Fun</h3>
<strong>That is the most important thing for me.</strong> If you are going to learn something by yourself, choose it well. Find something that you are interested and try to have fun learning it. It will help you to stay motivated, to find the time needed and to go through the hard days. Keep yourself focused and don’t be ashamed to be proud of yourself for every little new thing you learned. You deserve it.
<h3>5. Where to Start</h3>
The internet is full of e-courses and you can always start with a book if you prefer. My best experience was with Paul Hegarty’s iOS Application Development classes, one of the several amazing Stanford courses on iTunesU. You can find a great variety of free courses on <a href="https://www.coursera.org/" target="_blank">Coursera.org</a>, <a href="http://www.openculture.com/" target="_blank">OpenCulture.com</a>, <a href="https://www.edx.org/" target="_blank">edX.org</a> and others; some will even give you certificates and deadlines to help your motivation.

I had great experiences with self-learning and I can’t recommend it enough. It is amazing to be able to learn at your own rhythm and to be the only one responsible for your learning. It is a great way to improve your self-knowledge. When compared with the usual education I only missed the direct contact with people and to be able to have my questions answered in real time. Probably even that can be done nowadays with the right e-course.

Nobody can help you all the way, but it is well worth it.
