Recently, some people on my day job told me they are embarrassed because I study so much and they don't. They said they admire my passion for studying agile, modern management, coaching, modern software engineering, entrepreneurship, lean startup, etc. They recognize the importance of continuous improvement, expand horizons and strive for excellence in what they do. However, they told me they can't do that. And were embarrassed about that.

The first step to change, is to recognize the need for a change. And the fact that they have recognized it is something extremely positive. I was very happy to have inspired this thought somehow in them.

However, they told something else that bothered me a bit. They think that the reason for so much study is that I was getting ready to open my own company. They stated that I study so much only because I dream about opening my own business and want to use this knowledge there.

This is not completely wrong, but neither is correct. I always dreamed about opening my own business, and <a title="We are Alive!" href="http://felloway.com/2013/04/we-are-alive/" target="_blank">Felloway</a> and <a href="http://mixprintpaint.felloway.com" target="_blank">MixPrintPaint</a> are the achievement of this. However, this is not the main reason for me to study so much. I read a lot, listen to podcasts, attend to events, watch lectures remotely, pay for specialized courses, engage in communities and everything else because... I like it. Simple as that. I really like to gain knowledge. I like to understand how things work. I like to have more tools to broaden my horizons and think outside the box. I like to feel more competent every day. Feel that I'm learning, that I'm not making the same mistakes over and over again. I like to follow people who I consider great, and be inspired by them. I like to learn by doing, pursue new challenges and be prepared for what I have to face, even if it is to be prepared for the unexpected! I like to get carried away by passion and emotion. By the anxiety to do something amazing, even the smallest and simplest thing.

Definitely, I'm not excellent in everything I do. Far from it! But I seek it daily. And it is hard! And awesome too! This is the kind of thing that drives me. The kind of thing that gets me out of bed every day. The kind of thing that makes me not want to lie in bed in some days!
